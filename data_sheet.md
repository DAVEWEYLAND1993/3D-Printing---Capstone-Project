# Datasheet 

 
## Motivation

Dataset was created for the purpose of finding relations/correlations between the input parameters of 3D printers

The dataset was generated by a research team at TR/Selcuk University's Department of Mechanical Engineering

 
## Composition

The instances of the dataset represent printing parameters that can be altered before and during the printing process

Dataset contains 12 columns with each column containing 50 rows of data

Dataset contains no missing data and no data that could be considered confidential


## Collection process

The work was based on the Ultimaker S5 3D printer settings and filaments. 

Material and strength tests were performed using a Sincotec GMBH tester capable of pulling 20kN

There is no information available on over what timeframe the experiments were carried out

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

Data was normalised as the TurBo algorithm requires domain to be between 0 and 1 

Raw data is available to the public on Kaggle
 
## Uses

These kinds of datasets could be used for analysis of 3D bioprinting parameters as well

There are many experimental variables that have to be taken into consideration when looking at such datasets; were all the materials uniform? were there any technical issues with 3D printer during printing thsat could have impacted the results? any other experimental errors?

This dataset should only be used for 3D printing/bioprinting multi-objective optimisation

## Distribution

Dataset is available to public  

## Maintenance

No information was provided on dataset maintenance
